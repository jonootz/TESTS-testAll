        <h1>EndNotesPROXY</h1>
        <p>The following proxy can be used to generate a list of all end notes in your project. It is a way of grouping many notes in one location, such as at the very end of a manual (i.e., endnotes), rather than placing the notes, say, at the bottom of each page (i.e., footnotes). The proxy generates the list of endnotes based on those that you have created in the project with the position "Endnotes Proxy." Optional Task: You can select a style to affect the look of the entire list of endnotes. To do this, right-click on the proxy below and select <b>Edit Endnotes Proxy</b>. Then choose the appropriate style. If you need help, press <b>F1</b> when the dialog is open. When you are ready, you can delete this paragraph or replace it with your own text. <b>Note:</b> If you cannot see the proxy below, make sure your markers are turned on. To do this, in the local toolbar click the down arrow next to the <b>Show Tags</b> button and select <b>Show Markers</b>.</p>
