        <p>The XML Editor is the primary editor that is used in Flare. It provides access to the underlying XML structure of documents in a comfortable visual authoring environment. This editor is used to enter, modify, and format the content for topics that users see in the output<MadCap:footnote>My new footnote</MadCap:footnote>. Not only is this editor used for topics, but it is also used for working with master pages and snippets. Although this editor lets you produce XML<MadCap:footnote>My new footnote</MadCap:footnote> files, you do not need to know anything about XML to use it.</p>
