        <p>The XML Editor is the primary editor that is used in Flare. It provides access to the underlying XML structure of documents in a comfortable visual authoring environment. This editor is used to enter, modify, and format the content for topics that users see in the output. <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>Not only is this editor used for topics, but it is also used for working with master pages and snippets.</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>blah blah blah</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup> Although this editor lets you produce XML files, you do not need to know anything about XML to use it.</p>
